Git Cheat Sheet
====

Yet another cheat sheet of git commands.

Todo add basic log commands (with grep pipe), rebase commands for commit squashing (rebase -i HEAD^3, f).

Information on working copy, index and remote.

git commit --amend  to ammend the previous commit with the current added changes

git log sha - will show the log around that sha

git checkout - (switch back to the branch you were previously on)
